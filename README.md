 Controlling Position AND Speed of Motorized Faders using PCF8575 over I2C

Its worth mentioning that in this repo im using the ADS1015 to read the value of each fader!

The reason is because I completely ran out of pins on one of my projects, and so I have no analog or PWM pins left for reading and controlling the faders positions..

So make sure you make your own adjustments!
